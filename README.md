# Historical-Stock-Data
a python program to scrape some stock info for stocks on certain days

My dad runs a tax business... 21st Century Financial Services

I wrote this program to help him look up data more efficiently than grinding away on yahoo finance.

Future plans for this project include adding more searchable fields and creating a gui and maybe even making it a standalone web app
